### Lab Exercise

(The concept from the data, which is that there are 13 rows in which there is an x axis with specified values, and there is also a y with specific values)

answer task3
In the previous figure, I have the shape of a dinosaur and it has a correlation coefficient of -0,0645, and now I have the shape of a star and it has a correlation coefficient of -0,0630 when comparing the two shapes. The dinosaur has a larger correlation coefficient and the star has a lower correlation coefficient

answer task4
When comparing the shape of the dino and the circle, the special correlation coefficient for the dino is -0.0645, the correlation coefficient for the circuit is -0.0683, so the circuit has a larger correlation coefficient, and the dino has a lower correlation coefficient
